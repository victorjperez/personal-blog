It was the late afternoon, a Tuesday if I recall. I was sitting down with a hot cup of coffee after a day of classes. I’ve done this routine many times before. Sit down, study a bit, maybe get a refill or two, leave. While working on whatever particularly needed to get done that day, a conversation or two might catch my attention. It is a coffee shop after all, and people either sit down to chat or to work. The conversation topics are mostly mundane, but two men caught my attention through the soft music and light mummering of conversation.

“Oh I certainly do have a good life,” said the older man. He was adorned in a tan peacoat and business professional dress, though something about him told me he hadn’t show up to work today.

“Me too, I’m glad I get to travel,” said the younger man. He seemed in his late thirties, and was very cleanly dressed and groomed. “I visited Piscataway, and I couldn’t even pronounce the name right!” he chuckled. “I was on the phone trying to tell someone where I was and kept saying “Pah-scotch-way”, and finally they figured it out- I was talking about Piscataway!”

They both chuckled quietly.

“You know I actually went to grad school around there”, said the older man.

“I know where you’re talking about, my cousin might have went there too. How was that?

“Well, I never talked to the undergrads there, but I tell you- I always used to hang around the davis library. All of the girls hung around there!”

Another quiet chuckle.

“New Jersey is a weird place. I was at lowes once and the cashier was around 17 years old. He kept saying to me as he checked me out, he said to me “beg?””. The young man paused reflectively. “I was very confused, and he kept saying “beg” to me until he finally pointed to bags and I was like “Ohhhhh, bag!””

The chuckling was out of control.

“I don’t really speak New Jersian.”, stated the young man rather obviously. It was clear the conversation had long since died before I started listening. “Well I’m gonna havta get going now, we should chat again sometime.”

“Well I’m not going to be around here to long. I’m down here for the open mic night, but I dunno how long I’ll be around town”. The younger man seemed a little disappointed at this revelation. “I’m pretty easy to find though, if you want to chat while I’m around.” the old man was far too nice for his own good.
