<p>One day in Seattle Washington, two teams were set to compete for the 2.7 million dollar prize pool in Benaroya Hall. The vast crowd of adoring fans were preemptively waiting for the biggest sporting event they would ever experience in their entire lives, but this was no ordinary sporting event.

Each teams’ only aim was to destroy the enemy teams’ ancient, in the third Dota 2 international tournament.</p>
